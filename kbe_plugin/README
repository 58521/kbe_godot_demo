 PersistentInfos loadAll() doesn't have try/catch like C#. make sure works
 PersistentInfos file read/write should maybe use "user://" paths if it isn't passed them

 does events mutex need if(KBEngineApp.app == null) for monitor_Enter/Exit funcs?

 NetworkInterface should eventually support UDP and encryption

 Eventually fix grammar of functions/variables

 check to make sure all string addition has String() calls when needed, especially KBEngine.Dbg calls
 
 c# plugin gives unity directions in degrees, for godot should use radians
 
 App.gd line 1383 updatePlayerToServer() -- maybe godot already normalizes radians. check back
 
 not quite sure what FLT_MAX checks are in _updateVolatileData -- leaving for now. maybe change later
 
 CB tick vars should maybe have mutex in App.gd
 
----
 looks like it takes a long time on Client_onImportClientEntityDef and then
 fails on bundle.newMessage(Messages.messages["Baseapp_loginBaseapp"])
 when it tries to update properties on entity 107 which doesn't exist on 
 client...
 
 need to vet whole KBEngine.gd file to make sure logic is accurately copied 
 from c# plugin.
 
 -seems like it calls login_loginapp() twice from debug messages

 
 -the return false thing

###godot bugs
 pasting long string in search replace glitches it so you can't see text even after deleting
 bug once occured replacing many semicolons in large selection
 distraction free mode changes line number

###kbe c# plugin bugs:
 i think memoryStream writeString line 275 should be v.Length + 1

 onUpdatePropertys_(): if _bufferedCreateEntityMessage.has(eid): is suspect
 looks like it should be not has like all the other occurences, errors if check not has though.
