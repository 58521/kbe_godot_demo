 PersistentInfos loadAll() doesn't have try/catch like C#. make sure works
 PersistentInfos file read/write should maybe use "user://" paths if it isn't passed them

 does events mutex need if(KBEngineApp.app == null) for monitor_Enter/Exit funcs?

 Eventually fix grammar of functions/variables
 
 App.gd line 1383 updatePlayerToServer() -- maybe godot already normalizes radians. check back
 
 not quite sure what FLT_MAX checks are in _updateVolatileData -- leaving for now. maybe change later
 
 CB tick vars should maybe have mutex in App.gd
 
----

 -the return false thing. there was a return false somewhere with weird indentation after if statement in c# plugin. need to find again
 
 -connection drops sometimes without notifying client. networkinterface invalid when try to move
 -onKicked doesn't always work correctly. can bug it out sometimes by logging in

###godot bugs
 crash once occured replacing many semicolons in large selection
 distraction free mode changes line number

###kbe c# plugin bugs:
 i think memoryStream writeString line 275 should be v.Length + 1

 onUpdatePropertys_(): if _bufferedCreateEntityMessage.has(eid): is suspect
 looks like it should be not has like all the other occurences, errors if check not has though.
 
 _bufferedCreateEntityMessage[eid] is null in onCreatedProxies, position not getting set correctly
